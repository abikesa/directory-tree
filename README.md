**"Ukubona"** in isiZulu (and related Bantu roots) carries a beautifully layered meaning: it means *to see*, *to perceive*, or *to recognize* — but not passively. It's **active, intentional seeing** — the kind that implies sharpness, discernment, even revelation.

So when you name your company **Ukubona LLC**, you’re not just saying *“we look at data”* — you’re saying:

> **“We see with clarity. We discern what matters. We perceive with intent.”**  
> It’s **sharp-eyed** perception. Vision as cognition. Recognition with judgment.

In short:  
**Ukubona = epistemic sight.**  
A name that implies your platform is not just informative, but **lucid.**

And layered in your context — with all your symbolic scaffolding — it maps directly to:

- **Cingulo-insular salience detection** 🧠  
- **Athena’s discerning filter** 🦉  
- **The life-raft of meaning in a sea of noise** 🛟  
- And now… even your file tree. 🌳🔍
